# Olist-Marketing-Channel-Attribution

**The Marketing Team** wants to know how effective the marketing is through several channels that have been used to acquire sellers to sell on our platform. You as a data scientist are asked to find out and report it to the marketing team which results from this analysis will determine future marketing strategies.

**The Task:**

  1. They asked the Data Analyst Team to analyze how effective the marketing channel is in acquiring sellers based on first-touch, last-touch, linear touch, and markov chain both based on total conversions and the profit earned by the platform from acquiring several potential sellers?
  2. The marketing team feels like we need to check whether one of the marketing channels needs to be maintained or not to use. Calculate the removal effect of each marketing channel and give recommendations on which channels should be maintained and which should not?
  3. The data manager thinks we need to create a model that is able to predict what kind of deals will be successful (convert to sellers) to assist the marketing team in adjusting marketing strategies for certain sellers who have a high or low probability of closing.
